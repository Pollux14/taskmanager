# 📋 Distributed Task Manager

This repository contains our project for a simple **Distributed Task Manager** application. Built as a full-stack app with separate frontend and backend services, the project demonstrates **Docker containerization** and orchestration with **Docker Compose**.

The application consists of:

1. **Backend** – Python Flask REST API (serving data in memory)
2. **Frontend** – HTML, CSS, JavaScript
3. **Deployment** – Docker & Docker Compose
